# COMP3015-CW2

# How does the user interact with the software?
Just run the executable from the given file and you will be able to run and view the shader.

# How does the program code work?
The program has a few different scenes to interact, by changing the shader Integer you will be able to view the different shaders. The project calls different methods for each different shader, the init and compile method load the shaders and link them with their GLSL Program, the program then uses these to change the uniforms and apply different integers values and methods to the models and scenes.

# What makes your shader program special and how does it compare to similar things? 
This program is very simple depicting a few simple scenes to show off the shaders, 1 scene that shows off two shaders on a tree with some grass and the second scene a vertex animation shader that shows a rubber duck in a pool. I liked the idea of a small duck in a pool chilling out in the sun. The tree scene is simply a showcase of previous CW1 shader and a spotlight shader.
